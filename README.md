# AppR

Purpose of the file:
To make it easier to run files one after another

Usage:
Place the exe files that you want to install into the different folders. For exe files within nested folders, create a shortcut to the .exe file.

First Run of the application will create the folder structure

Common Folder: The files inside will be the one that are usually required to be installed
Softwares Folder: The files inside will be occasionally required. There will be buttons for each .exe file that is present in the folder

The items in the common folder will automatically be checked while the items in the Softwares folder will not. 
After selecting the relavant software to be installed, click install to continue.
