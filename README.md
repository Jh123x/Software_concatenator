# Multipurpose software installer

Purpose of the file:
It is to make installer software more convenient for installs over multiple computers with different software needs. The installer will run one after another when they are all done


Usage:
Place the exe files that you want to install into the different folders. For exe files within nested folders, create a shortcut to the .exe file.

Common Folder: The files inside will be the one that are usually required to be installed

Softwares Folder: The files inside will be occasionally required. There will be buttons for each .exe file that is present in the folder



TODO:
1. Change the format of the software to checkboxes instead with the items in the common folder checked and the items in the softwares folder unchecked.

2. Fix bugs on marginal cases

3. A better GUI
